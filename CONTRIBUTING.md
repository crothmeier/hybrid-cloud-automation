# Contributing

Contributions to **Hybrid Cloud Automation** are welcome! Since this repository serves as a reference for orchestrating hybrid cloud deployments, contributions are optional and primarily to enhance transparency and utility.

## How to Contribute

1. **Fork the repository** to your GitHub account.
2. **Create a branch** for your update (e.g., `improve/azure-variables`).
3. **Implement your changes** (update Terraform code, add examples, etc.) with clear commit messages.
4. **Open a Pull Request** detailing the changes and reasoning.

## Guidelines

- Keep Terraform code formatted (use `terraform fmt`).
- Ensure any example credentials or sensitive values are placeholders, not real.
- Verify that changes don't break the existing templates for others.
